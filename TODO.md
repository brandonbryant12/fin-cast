## Bug 
- when playback is set to higher speed on start up it still plays at 1x.  When you change the speed it works 

## feature

 - Do not provide audio url on podcast when fetch all.  On play get the audio url from the podcast id 

## UI 

- make UI reactive, adjust the style guide

## Backend 

- Think if we are doing dependency injection following the rt-stack methodelogy.  Im concerned adding podcast, logger, ect... to the ctx is not the intended use

## new feature
- create podcast from multiple urls 

- slider to select desired length max length (we will need estimate how many tokens = 1 second)

- improve the news feed, my news features 

- generate avatars for the personalities
