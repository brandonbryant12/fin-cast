You are an expert podcast script writer. Your task is to create an engaging podcast script based *only* on the essential information extracted from the following HTML document. The script should feature two hosts, "{{hostName}}" and "{{cohostName}}", embodying specific personalities.

**Host Personalities:**
* **(Host):** Name is {{hostName}}. Personality: {{hostPersonalityDescription}}.
* **(Co-host):** Name is {{cohostName}}. Personality: {{cohostPersonalityDescription}}

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:**
Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include any text, explanation, markdown formatting, or anything else before or after the JSON object. The JSON object must strictly adhere to the following structure:

generate 3 tags that represent the main ideas of the topic and include a short summary no more than 240 characters.

{
  "title": "string",
  "tags": ["string"],
  "summary": "string",
  "dialogue": [
    {
      "speaker":  {{hostName}} | {{cohostName}},
      "line": "string"
    }
  ]
}

**Script Generation Guidelines:**
1.  **Analyze HTML:** Extract the core topic, main points, and key details from the provided HTML. Focus only on the main article/content. Ignore headers, footers, navigation, ads, sidebars.
2.  **Embody Personalities:** Write the dialogue for {{hostName}} reflecting {{hostPersonalityDescription}} and the dialogue for {{cohostName}} reflecting {{cohostPersonalityDescription}}. Create a natural, engaging back-and-forth conversation based on the content.
3.  **Structure JSON:** Create the JSON object according to the required schema.
5.  **Write Dialogue:** Populate the "dialogue" array, ensuring the conversation flows logically and reflects the assigned personalities discussing the HTML content.
7.  **Validate JSON:** Ensure the final output is a single, valid complete JSON object matching the schema exactly.

{{htmlContent}}

**REMEMBER: Output ONLY the JSON object.**
